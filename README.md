### SolidVehicles
This was an exercise to practice C# interfaces.

1. Use your knowledge of the Interface Segregation Principle and the
Dependency Inversion Principle to convert the code below into a system
that is more flexible and extensible to accommodate any kind of vehicle
class. Each class should only implement code that it needs.
2. Create at least two types of each vehicle (water based, ground based, and air based). I've given you one of each kind.
3. Complete the tasks in the the `Main()` method.
